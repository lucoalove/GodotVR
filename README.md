# GodotVR

Experimental, lightweight VR social platform in Godot.

First things to implement:
- tracking
- teleportation movement

## Roadmap

- Physbones (has a default angle but will flop with movement)
- Rigbones (tracks your movement)
- [Multiplayer](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/networking/high_level_multiplayer.html) (serialization ;-;)
- Modding support (custom worlds/models)
  - Using [FileDialogue](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_filedialog.html) node?
  - Using [Packs](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.2/getting_started/workflow/export/exporting_pcks.html)?
